# ONNX Model Placeholder

This is a placeholder file for the SRGAN model.

To use the application, please:

1. Download the SRGAN model file (srgan_generator.onnx)
2. Place it in this directory (public/)

The application expects the model file to be named exactly "srgan_generator.onnx".

If you do not have the model file, you can either:
1. Use a pre-trained SRGAN model for image enhancement
2. Train your own SRGAN model using the ONNX format
3. Convert an existing PyTorch or TensorFlow SRGAN model to ONNX format

Note: The SRGAN model should have the standard architecture for image super-resolution.
